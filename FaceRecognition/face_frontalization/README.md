# Face Frontalization
This is a Python port of the Face Frontalization code provided by Hassner *et al.* at http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/frontalize

The original code was written in Matlab and was ported to Python using Numpy and OpenCV.

### Dependencies
[Dlib Python Wraper](http://dlib.net) >= 18.17

[OpenCV Python Wraper](http://opencv.org/downloads.html) >= 3.0.0

[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)


- Windows x64: I have provided compiled binaries for OpenCV 3.0.0 and Dib 18.18 [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7pvh2tbCWLLdElLYURTODdZSzg/view?usp=sharing). Just drag the files to your python packages folder (e.g. site-packages). If they don't work, you'll have to compile them yourself.
- Linux/OSX: You'll have to compile OpenCV and Dlib yourself.

### Other Dependencies
To run demo.py you must have:

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
