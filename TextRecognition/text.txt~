Do you ever hear your parents mumble something about global warming and you
don’t know what they are talking about? If you wanted to know, you’re in luck! All the stuff
you wanted to know about global warming is in this report! You will learn what global
warming is, what it does and how we can try and stop it.

Global warming is the unnatural warming of Earth’s average temperature. It’s
unnatural because humans are causing it to happen. Ever since the Industrial Revolution
began about 150 years ago, the earth has been warming. Because of this the natural carbon
cycle has been disrupted. Everything on earth is part of the natural carbon cycle. Here is a
small example of how the cycle goes. Plants die and release CO2. After that, other plants take
it in and they grow. Animals eat the plants and let out the C02. This ﬁnishes the cycle.
Lately, the cycle has been disrupted by humans. We have affected it by using cars, factories,
homes, etc. Global warming is a problem we have to solve now. You may have heard of the
greenhouse effect. It’s what keeps our planet from becoming an ice box. It’s called the
greenhouse effect because it traps some of the heat that comes in like a greenhouse trapping
heat to grow plants. “The greenhouse effect is essential to life on earth.” (Evans)

The normal greenhouse effect keeps the average temperature at 57 degrees F but when
we are emitting extreme amounts of C02 we make the effect turn bad. We must stop this. The
main source responsible for climate change and/or global warming is carbon dioxide, C02.
“The average American adult lets out 20 tons of CO2 a year. The average kids releases 2 .
tons a year.” (David and Gordon) Other main greenhouse gases are methane, carbon
monoxide and nitrous oxide. All these gases are more powerful than C02. We let out 82% of
C02, 9% methane, 5% NO, and 4% of others. If we don’t lower our emissions, there is a

possibility that we’ll run out of our non-renewable fossil fuels. The effects of global warming
